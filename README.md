Hey There!

Keep My Notes was created as a personal project by myself, Thomas Wicks.

My main goal with this project was to jump into furthering my React skills with my most technically abitious project yet, and I also really wanted to create a project that incorporated some sort of database -- since everything I've created up until this point has been static.

I chose Google Firebase as my back-end poison of choice, and coupled with React, I got down to coding!

The learning experience that this project has presented has been phenominal to my growth as a web developer. I was able to learn and incorporate Firebase authentication and the Firestore -- both of which I've been eager to put into a project for a while now, as well as learn more about how React works than I initially thought I would have.

Thank you again for taking the time to check out Keep My Notes, I truly hope you like what I've created here!

## 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
